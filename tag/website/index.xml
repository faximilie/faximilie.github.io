There&amp;rsquo;s a big reason why it&amp;rsquo;s so empty, Opsec.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of my life protecting my identities from a real life counterpart. Thus protecting me from fallout of my poor decisions in my youth. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m in my 20s, and looking for work, I do need an identity closely tied to my real life identity. So this identity was created to facilitate that, so that I can still provide personal details publicly without cross contaminating with other identities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus this identity, and by extension this website does not have much content. All my achievements are strewn across various identities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this Identity isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>that&lt;/em> new, it&amp;rsquo;s not been utilized much. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start using it more for projects that don&amp;rsquo;t require separation of identities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So hopefully this website will be more appealing to employers in the near future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello Hugo</title><link>/post/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello, this is a very simple post to say that this website is now working.
