[{"authors":[null],"categories":["security"],"content":"This website looks very bare, not many projects and posts. There\u0026rsquo;s a big reason why it\u0026rsquo;s so empty, Opsec.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve spent a lot of my life protecting my identities from a real life counterpart. Thus protecting me from fallout of my poor decisions in my youth. Now that I\u0026rsquo;m in my 20s, and looking for work, I do need an identity closely tied to my real life identity. So this identity was created to facilitate that, so that I can still provide personal details publicly without cross contaminating with other identities.\nThus this identity, and by extension this website does not have much content. All my achievements are strewn across various identities.\nWhile this Identity isn\u0026rsquo;t that new, it\u0026rsquo;s not been utilized much. I\u0026rsquo;m going to start using it more for projects that don\u0026rsquo;t require separation of identities.\nSo hopefully this website will be more appealing to employers in the near future.\n","date":1558483200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558483200,"objectID":"ea043fe68a858801d1ba55e137fa913b","permalink":"/post/simple-opsec/","publishdate":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/simple-opsec/","section":"post","summary":"A explaination for the lack of content on this website.","tags":["website","security","meta"],"title":"Simple Opsec","type":"post"},{"authors":[null],"categories":["meta"],"content":"Hello, this is a very simple post to say that this website is now working.
